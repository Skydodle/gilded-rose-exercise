# Gilded Rose - JS/Jest

## Requirements

You'll want to look at the ["requirements"](requirements.txt) which
explains what the code is for. I strongly advise you that you'll also
need some tests if you want to make sure you don't break the code
while you refactor.

You could write some unit tests yourself, using the requirements to
identify suitable test cases. I've provided a failing unit test in a
popular test framework as a starting point for most languages.

The idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and
improve your skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea
is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice
designing tests, taking small steps, running the tests often, and
incrementally improving the design.
